Stacks and Queues

There are two storage systems present, one is a stack and the other queue. The content of the stack is [13, 6] and the content of the queue is [22, 23, 17, 21, 26, 29, 15, 27, 28, 19] (the first item in both represent the first item stored). The number on each item represent the ID of item.

We have to balance these storage systems (move items between storages so that there are equal number of items in both). Keeping in mind the functionalities of stacks and queues, we have to balance them!

    
STACK STORAGE: oldest  [13, 6]  newest
